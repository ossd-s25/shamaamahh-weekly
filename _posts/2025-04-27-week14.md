# The Beginning of Presentations

This week, we officially began presentations! It's been exciting seeing everyone's projects come to life after so many weeks of hard work. I really enjoyed the presentation about Hugging Face. It was fascinating to learn more about the open source contributions people make to machine learning libraries. One slide that stood out to me showcased individual contributions, including PRs submitted and issues resolved. It really highlighted how much work goes into maintaining and improving these projects behind the scenes.

# Our Group's Upcoming Presentation

Our group is presenting tomorrow! We've been working hard to make sure everything is ready. This week, we finalized our project on **Lucide**, ran through multiple practice sessions, and carefully adjusted our slides to fit the time limit. We made decisions about what to condense and what to highlight so we can tell the story of our project clearly and effectively.

Feeling confident and excited to share our work with everyone tomorrow!
