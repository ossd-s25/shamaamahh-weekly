title: Week 13 - This Week's Update on Group Project and Open Source in Film
---

# Group Project Update

Since our last meeting, our team has made steady progress on various contributions to the Lucide project. A few new icons were created and submitted, including a saxophone, butterfly, nursing mother, and an AI summary icon. In addition, multiple GitHub issues were opened, some suggesting new features, others focused on website improvements, and one of these issues already has a related pull request in review. There was also engagement with existing issues, including one related to React v19 and another older Svelte issue that may have useful applications elsewhere.

On the technical side, there was some exploration into extending Lucide to Qwik, though we concluded that the community support isn’t strong enough at this time to justify moving forward.

## Short-Term Goals

Looking ahead, we plan to meet again over the weekend (Saturday or Sunday) to continue contributing. The goal is to maintain momentum, address open issues, and push forward with more meaningful updates to the project.

# Open Source in Film

One of the coolest parts of the video is when Larry Gritz talks about how Open Shading Language (OSL) was originally developed at Sony Pictures Imageworks but then made open source. It is now used by studios all over the world. He said it allowed artists to write physically based shaders in amuch more intuitive way, and because it's open, studios like Pixar and Netflix can adapt it to their own pipelines. It's kind of wild how something that started as an internal tool became a global standard just because they decided to share it.

I also found it really interesting that the Linux Foundation and the Academy teamed up to create the Academy Software Foundation, which feels like a pretty unexpected collaboration. But by bringing open source practices into the film industry, they’ve helped streamline tools and make production more efficient. It’s cool to see how two very different worlds came together and ended up creating something super useful for the industry and they can’t seem to live without now.

## Why Open Source in Film?

- It enables studios to collaborate instead of compete on technical tools.
- Encourages shared standards, which reduces inefficiencies and duplication.
- Especially useful for large scale visual effects (VFX) and animation.

## Key Open Source Projects

- Open Shading Language (OSL): Allows artists to write custom shaders.
- OpenEXR: A high dynamic range image file format developed by ILM.
- OpenColorIO: Manages color spaces for consistent visuals.

## Impact on Workflow

- Tools are now more modular, customizable, and interoperable.
- Artists and engineers can innovate without reinventing basic tools.
- Netflix uses these tools to manage color consistency across many devices.

## Takeaway
Open source has become a foundation of modern film production. It enhances creativity, improves efficiency, and builds community across the film industry.
