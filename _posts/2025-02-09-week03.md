title: Week 3 - First Group Browser Extention!
---

## Our Idea

For our browser extention, we decided on on *Color1ze*, a Chrome extension that allows users to customize text color on any loaded webpage. Users can choose from solid colors or an animated rainbow effect to enhance their browsing experience. We replaced the letter **"i"** with the number **"1"** to represent us being group one, thus portraying a fun way to integrate our ideawith our team number. 

Essentially, users can:

- Select a solid color for text on a webpage.

- Apply a rainbow gradient effect to text dynamically.

- Toggle between different styles effortlessly.

We want to make reading webpages more fun and customizable, straying away from the conventions of the boring default black text color. With *Color1ze*, web page users will have control over the way they see webpage text. The hope is that users will be inclined to be more active with their online readings, thus promoting productivity and the power of choice in their web browsing. They will gain a sense of control over their viewership and feel more involved rather than mindlessly scrolling through the web.

## Progress

My group members created a manifest.json, content.js, and CSS files to bring our idea to life. Our group will finalize the code on our next meeting to be able to present to the class. It is a work in progress, but defintely challenging. I have personally never coded in java script so it is a first time experience for me.

## My Role in the Project

I created the **README** documentation for the project, making sure that it clearly explains the extension’s functionality, purpose, and installation process. By structuring the document neatly and providing step-by-step instructions, I aimed to make it easier for users and developers to understand and use the *Color1ze* Chrome extension.

## Goals to reach the finish line

1. As we approach the final stages of our project, there are a few key goals we need to accomplish:

2. Finalize and Test the Code – We need to ensure that our JavaScript, CSS, and manifest file work seamlessly together. This includes debugging any issues and making sure the extension applies color changes correctly on different webpages.

3. Prepare for Presentation – Our final goal is to present our extension to the class. This includes preparing a demo that highlights key features and discussing our development process, challenges, and takeaways from the experience.
