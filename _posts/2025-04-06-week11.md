title: Week 11 - Project Update and Presentation Reflection
---

## The Project

Our group has been making steady progress on our open source contributions, and I’m proud of what I’ve been able to contribute so far. One of the things I worked on was fixing a broken and outdated info link related to using Lucide with Flutter. It might seem small, but it was important to update that documentation so other developers don’t run into confusion when integrating Lucide with Flutter projects. They have since archived Flutter compatibility.

I also created an SVG icon of a pair of drumsticks, which was something I thought was missing from the current collection. There’s a noticeable lack of music-related icons, so I figured this would be a good way to help fill that gap. It felt really good to contribute something creative and useful that others might benefit from.

In the remaining few weeks, I’m hoping to continue adding to the icon library, maybe a few more music related icons if possible. Our group reached out to the maintainer but unfortunately, he did not respond. I think it's better for our group to focus on the smaller contributions to wrap up the semester

## Presentation Thoughts

I really enjoyed Shivam Balikondwar’s presentation this week. It was encouraging to hear how he got started with open source and how he didn’t let initial challenges stop him. His story made the whole process of contributing feel a lot more approachable and reminded me that even small steps like fixing links or making icons can lead to larger, more impactful work over time.

What stood out to me most was how he talked about building a network through open source. I hadn’t thought much about that before, but it makes sense when you contribute to the same projects as others, it naturally opens the door to conversations, collaborations, and even opportunities beyond the code. Definitely gave me a new perspective on the bigger picture of what we’re doing and how open source contributions are more than just code.
